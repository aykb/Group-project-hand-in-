        "A dataset can be considered biased if it is not representative of the true population for the values of specific attributes of interest, called *protected or sensitive attributes*. Protected attributes are categorical and their identification depends on the domain at hand; typical examples are race, gender, and age. Bias can be detected by computing specific fairness-related metrics, which compare in various ways the distributions of the groups of interests, or checking for under-represented parts of the target population in the dataset (*representation bias*). In both cases, bias can originate from how and where the data was originally collected or it can be introduced, sometimes amplified, during the data preparation steps preceding any analytical task. In both cases, working with data that are not representative of a given population could make the outcome of the decision system for that population unreliable. In some other situations, even if the result is trustworthy, it might be illegal or unwanted for domain-dependent reasons to base any decision on such attributes."

        "Now that we have specified the protected attribute 'age', defined privileged and unprivileged groups, and understood the dataset content, we can use the aif360 package to detect bias (Step 2.2). Once bias has been detected, we could mitigate it using specific methods transforming the original training dataset (Step 2.3). We finally redect bias on the transformed dataset, showing that now bias has been removed (Step 2.3).\n",
        "\n",
        "Such methods can be used before applying any machine learning task, with a special focus to classification. For this reason, as a first step, and even if this is not mandatory for the proposed activity, we split the original dataset into training and testing datasets (Step 2.1), as usually done in machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "We remark that the approach presented in Part 2 assumes the dataset is ready for the model generation. However, data analytics pipelines are in general very complex; sometimes, before the model is generated (and before splitting the dataset), the dataset is prepared (cleaned, integrated, transformed) in a more database-oriented style. Each of these steps can impact fairness, amplifying the bias of the original dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bias in the result of the transformed dataset can of course be mitigated using the approaches introduced in Step 2.3 but specific approaches have also been proposed to tackle bias in most of the common data preparation steps. Have a look at [1] for some short survey on such methods. This topic is not further addressed in this activity.\n",

Instead of reweighing, one could also apply techniques (non-discrimination constraints) such as suppression (remove sensitive attributes) or massaging the dataset — modify the labels (change the labels appropriately to remove discrimination from the training data).
